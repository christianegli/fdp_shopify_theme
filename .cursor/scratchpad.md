# Project Scratchpad
**Current Role:** Planner
**MVP Status:** Not Started
**GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/christianegli/fdp_shopify_theme
**Last Push:** 2025-06-13T09:15:00Z

## Background and Motivation
The client requests a redesign of the current Shopify theme to emulate the look and feel of Dior's official fashion site (https://www.dior.com/de_de/fashion?animate=true). The goal is to elevate the store's visual identity to match luxury brand standards and improve user perception and engagement.

## Research Findings
### Competitive Analysis
- **Dior (Reference Site):**
  - Clean, minimalist layout with significant white space
  - Elegant serif typography (e.g., custom "Dior" font) combined with modern sans-serif for UI elements
  - Large, high-resolution hero imagery & full-width videos
  - Sticky top navigation that expands into a full-screen mega-menu overlay
  - Subtle micro-interactions (fade-in animations, smooth scrolling)
  - Monochrome palette (black, white, light gray) with occasional accent colors
  - Grid-based product listing with generous spacing, hover-zoom effects, and concise info reveal
  - Emphasis on storytelling sections (Savoir-Faire, Editorial) using full-bleed imagery and rich media
  - Distraction-free footer with multilayered links in small type, tinted background

### User Pain Points (from typical premium-brand customers)
1. Current theme feels generic and does not convey luxury, reducing perceived product value.
2. Navigation is cluttered; customers struggle to discover collections quickly.
3. Visual storytelling is weak; limited use of immersive imagery and editorial sections.

- [ ] Simplified sticky header with logo left, centered menu trigger, right-aligned icons. **ESSENTIAL**
- [ ] Mega-menu overlay with two-column layout and large background image. **ESSENTIAL**
- [ ] Product grid redesign: larger thumbnails, hover zoom, price hidden until hover or subtle below image. **ESSENTIAL**
- [ ] Basic storytelling section template (full-bleed image + text overlay). **ESSENTIAL**
